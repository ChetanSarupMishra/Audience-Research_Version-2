# Open Deep Research

Open Deep Research is an experimental, fully open-source research assistant that automates deep research and produces comprehensive reports on any topic. It features three implementations - a [workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/), a multi-agent architecture, and an updated workflow with MCP and native model provider web search support. You can customize the entire research and writing process with specific models, prompts, and tools.

```

#### Workflow

(1) Provide a `Topic`:

<img width="1326" alt="input" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de264b1b-8ea5-4090-8e72-e1ef1230262f" />

(2) This will generate a report plan and present it to the user for review.

(3) We can pass a string (`"..."`) with feedback to regenerate the plan based on the feedback.

<img width="1326" alt="feedback" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c308e888-4642-4c74-bc78-76576a2da919" />

(4) Or, we can just pass `true` to the JSON input box in Studio accept the plan.

<img width="1480" alt="accept" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddeeb33b-fdce-494f-af8b-bd2acc1cef06" />

(5) Once accepted, the report sections will be generated.

<img width="1326" alt="report_gen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74ff01cc-e7ed-47b8-bd0c-4ef615253c46" />

The report is produced as markdown.

<img width="1326" alt="report" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d9f7b7-3aea-4025-be99-7fb0d4b47289" />

#### Multi-agent

(1) Chat with the agent about your topic of interest, and it will initiate report generation:

<img width="1326" alt="input" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc8f59dd-14b3-4a62-ac18-d2f99c8bbe83" />

(2) The report is produced as markdown.

#### MCP Workflow

(1) Configure the agent with the search tool of your choice. By default, the agent will use Tavily. You can configure it to use OpenAI or Anthropic native web search tools as well, or configure a custom MCP server and tools to use as well.

(2) Chat with the agent about your topic of interest, and it will initiate report generation.

(3) The agent will conduct research up front, iteratively, and once it is satisfied with the research, will generate a report plan.

(4) The agent will then generate the report in one-shot, provided the research it conducted, the report plan it generated, and the sources it collected.

### Search Tools

Available search tools:

* [Tavily API](https://tavily.com/) - General web search
* [Perplexity API](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-sonar-pro-api) - General web search
* [Exa API](https://exa.ai/) - Powerful neural search for web content
* [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) - Academic papers in physics, mathematics, computer science, and more
* [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) - Biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books
* [Linkup API](https://www.linkup.so/) - General web search
* [DuckDuckGo API](https://duckduckgo.com/) - General web search

NOTE: Only Tavily is provided by default for the MCP Workflow - the main usage pattern for the MCP Workflow implementation is connecting MCP servers of your choice. 

Open Deep Research is compatible with many different LLMs: 

* You can select any model that is integrated [with the `init_chat_model()` API](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/)
* See full list of supported integrations [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html)

### Using the package

```bash
pip install open-deep-research
```

See [src/open_deep_research/graph.ipynb](src/open_deep_research/graph.ipynb) and [src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.ipynb](src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.ipynb) for example usage in a Jupyter notebook:

## Open Deep Research Implementations

Open Deep Research features three distinct implementation approaches, each with its own strengths:

## 1. Graph-based Workflow Implementation (`src/open_deep_research/graph.py`)

![open-deep-research-overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a171660d-b735-4587-ab2f-cd771f773756)

The graph-based implementation follows a structured plan-and-execute workflow:

- **Planning Phase**: Uses a planner model to analyze the topic and generate a structured report plan
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allows for human feedback and approval of the report plan before proceeding
- **Parallel Research Process**: Creates sections in parallel with reflection between search iterations
- **Section-Specific Research**: Each section has dedicated search queries and content retrieval
- **Supports Multiple Search Tools**: Works with all search providers (Tavily, Perplexity, Exa, ArXiv, PubMed, Linkup, etc.)

This implementation provides a more interactive experience with greater control over the report structure, making it ideal for situations where report quality and accuracy are critical.

You can customize the research assistant workflow through several parameters:

- `report_structure`: Define a custom structure for your report (defaults to a standard research report format)
- `number_of_queries`: Number of search queries to generate per section (default: 2)
- `max_search_depth`: Maximum number of reflection and search iterations (default: 2)
- `planner_provider`: Model provider for planning phase (default: "anthropic", but can be any provider from supported integrations with `init_chat_model` as listed [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html))
- `planner_model`: Specific model for planning (default: "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest")
- `planner_model_kwargs`: Additional parameter for planner_model
- `writer_provider`: Model provider for writing phase (default: "anthropic", but can be any provider from supported integrations with `init_chat_model` as listed [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html))
- `writer_model`: Model for writing the report (default: "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
- `writer_model_kwargs`: Additional parameter for writer_model
- `search_api`: API to use for web searches (default: "tavily", options include "perplexity", "exa", "arxiv", "pubmed", "linkup")

## 2. Multi-Agent Implementation (`src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.py`)

![multi-agent-researcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c734c3c-57aa-4bc0-85dd-74e2ec2c0880)

The multi-agent implementation uses a supervisor-researcher architecture:

- **Supervisor Agent**: Manages the overall research process, plans sections, and assembles the final report
- **Researcher Agents**: Multiple independent agents work in parallel, each responsible for researching and writing a specific section
- **Parallel Processing**: All sections are researched simultaneously, significantly reducing report generation time
- **Specialized Tool Design**: Each agent has access to specific tools for its role (search for researchers, section planning for supervisors)
- **Search and MCP Support**: Works with Tavily/DuckDuckGo for web search, MCP servers for local/external data access, or can operate without search tools using only MCP tools

This implementation focuses on efficiency and parallelization, making it ideal for faster report generation with less direct user involvement.

You can customize the multi-agent implementation through several parameters:

- `supervisor_model`: Model for the supervisor agent (default: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
- `researcher_model`: Model for researcher agents (default: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest") 
- `number_of_queries`: Number of search queries to generate per section (default: 2)
- `search_api`: API to use for web searches (default: "tavily", options include "duckduckgo", "none")
- `ask_for_clarification`: Whether the supervisor should ask clarifying questions before research (default: false) - **Important**: Set to `true` to enable the Question tool for the supervisor agent
- `mcp_server_config`: Configuration for MCP servers (optional)
- `mcp_prompt`: Additional instructions for using MCP tools (optional)
- `mcp_tools_to_include`: Specific MCP tools to include (optional)

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

The multi-agent implementation (`src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.py`) supports MCP servers to extend research capabilities beyond web search. MCP tools are available to research agents alongside or instead of traditional search tools, enabling access to local files, databases, APIs, and other data sources.

#### Key Features

- **Tool Integration**: MCP tools are seamlessly integrated with existing search and section-writing tools
- **Research Agent Access**: Only research agents (not supervisors) have access to MCP tools
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use MCP tools alone or combined with web search
- **Disable Default Search**: Set `search_api: "none"` to disable web search tools entirely
- **Custom Prompts**: Add specific instructions for using MCP tools

#### Filesystem Server Example

##### SKK

```python
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "search_api": "none",  # Use "tavily"  combine with web search
        "mcp_server_config": {
            "filesystem": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                    "/path/to/your/files"
                ],
                "transport": "stdio"
            }
        },
        "mcp_prompt": "Step 1: Use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to get the list of allowed directories. Step 2: Use the `read_file` tool to read files in the allowed directory.",
        "mcp_tools_to_include": ["list_allowed_directories", "list_directory", "read_file"]  # Optional: specify which tools to include
    }
}
```

##### Studio

MCP server config: 
```
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/open_deep_research/src/open_deep_research/files"
    ],
    "transport": "stdio"
  }
}
```

MCP prompt: 
```
CRITICAL: You MUST follow this EXACT sequence when using filesystem tools:

1. FIRST: Call `list_allowed_directories` tool to discover allowed directories
2. SECOND: Call `list_directory` tool on a specific directory from step 1 to see available files  
3. THIRD: Call `read_file` tool to read specific files found in step 2

DO NOT call `list_directory` or `read_file` until you have first called `list_allowed_directories`. You must discover the allowed directories before attempting to browse or read files.
```

MCP tools: 
```
list_allowed_directories
list_directory 
read_file
```

Example test topic and follow-up feedback that you can provide that will reference the included file: 

Topic:
```
I want an overview of vibe coding
```

Follow-up to the question asked by the research agent: 

```
I just want a single section report on vibe coding that highlights an interesting / fun example
```

Resulting trace: 

https://smith.langchain.com/public/d871311a-f288-4885-8f70-440ab557c3cf/r

#### Configuration Options

- **`mcp_server_config`**: Dictionary defining MCP server configurations (see [langchain-mcp-adapters examples](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters#client-1))
- **`mcp_prompt`**: Optional instructions added to research agent prompts for using MCP tools
- **`mcp_tools_to_include`**: Optional list of specific MCP tool names to include (if not set, all tools from all servers are included)
- **`search_api`**: Set to `"none"` to use only MCP tools, or keep existing search APIs to combine both

#### Common Use Cases

- **Local Documentation**: Access project documentation, code files, or knowledge bases
- **Database Queries**: Connect to databases for specific data retrieval
- **API Integration**: Access external APIs and services
- **File Analysis**: Read and analyze local files during research

The MCP integration allows research agents to incorporate local knowledge and external data sources into their research process, creating more comprehensive and context-aware reports.


## 3. MCP Workflow Implementation (`src/open_deep_research/mcp_workflow/mcp_workflow.py`)

![mcp-workflow-overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76477350-3df6-4c3c-907a-c901fa493e78)

The MCP Workflow implementation makes use of more up-front research before trying to write the report. It is a blend of the above two approaches, where the agent is given more flexibility to call tools, but in a more on-rails fashion within a research and reflection loop.

They key emphasis of this approach is configurability. We allow you to configure the search API (Tavily, OpenAI Web Search, or Anthropic Web Search), or add custom MCP servers of your choice. The combination of the search API and any MCP tools that you configure is exposed to the LLM via tool-calling. 

The core of this approach is our Research Unit. Our Research Unit consists of a research phase, followed by a reflection phase. In the research phase, we call tools in a ReAct style loop, and return the search results from the tools into our message history. This affords us the flexibility to call several MCP tools in a loop. When we are done calling MCP tools, or when a web search tool is called, we end the research phase, and proceed to Reflection. The reflection phase decides if we have conducted enough research. Our findings from the research phase are written to State as "notes", and the reflection phase reviews these notes and reasons about whether or not we have enough.
If the reflection phase is satisfied with our research, or we have researched the maximum number of times (configured by user), we continue to the writing phase where we generate our response. If the reflection phase is not satisfied, we return to the research phase, with some recommendations (from our reflection model) about what else we should research to best answer the user's question.

When writing the final report, we first generate a report plan to give our writer some structure to follow, and then we generate the report.

You can customize the MCP Workflow implementation through several parameters:
- `search_api`: API to use for web searches (default: "tavily", other options are OpenAI native web search, and Anthropic native web search)
- `max_search_depth`: The maximum number of research -> reflection loops to iterate for, before proceeding to generate the final report.
- `summarization_model`: The model used to summarize search results from Tavily
- `research_model`: The model used to call tools in the Research phase. NOTE: If you are using OpenAI native web search or Anthropic native web search as your `search_api`, your `research_model` MUST support web search from that provider.
- `reflection_model`: The model used to reflect upon the quality of our research
- `outliner_model`: The model used to create an outline for our final response. We found that openai:gpt-4.1 works well for this structured output response.
- `final_report_model`: The model used to write our final response from all of our research findings.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

The MCP Workflow supports MCP servers to extend research capabilities beyond web search. MCP tools are available to research agents alongside traditional search tools, enabling access to local files, databases, APIs, and other data sources. The MCP Workflow was build to be compatible with Open Agent Platform, which is the primary means through which we expect folks to connect to their MCP servers and expose tools to end users.

#### Arcade Example

##### Studio
MCP config:
```
{
  "url": "https://api.arcade.dev/v1/mcps/ms_0ujssxh0cECutqzMgbtXSGnjorm"
  "tools": ["Search_SearchHotels", "Search_SearchOneWayFlights", "Search_SearchRoundtripFlights"]
}
```

MCP prompt:
```
Use these tools to look up information about flights and hotels
```
##### Open Agent Platform
Follow this [quickstart guide](https://docs.oap.langchain.com/quickstart) for Open Agent Platform to deploy the MCP Workflow on OAP!

Open Agent Platform is a UI from which non-technical users can build and configure their own agents. Each user can configure the MCP Workflow Deep Researcher with different MCP tools and search APIs that are best suited to their needs and the problems that they want to solve.

## Search API Configuration

Not all search APIs support additional configuration parameters. Here are the ones that do:

- **Exa**: `max_characters`, `num_results`, `include_domains`, `exclude_domains`, `subpages`
  - Note: `include_domains` and `exclude_domains` cannot be used together
  - Particularly useful when you need to narrow your research to specific trusted sources, ensure information accuracy, or when your research requires using specified domains (e.g., academic journals, government sites)
  - Provides AI-generated summaries tailored to your specific query, making it easier to extract relevant information from search results
- **ArXiv**: `load_max_docs`, `get_full_documents`, `load_all_available_meta`
- **PubMed**: `top_k_results`, `email`, `api_key`, `doc_content_chars_max`
- **Linkup**: `depth`

Example with Exa configuration:
```python
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
                           "search_api": "exa",
                           "search_api_config": {
                               "num_results": 5,
                               "include_domains": ["nature.com", "sciencedirect.com"]
                           },
                           # Other configuration...
                           }}
```

## Model Considerations

(1) You can use models supported with [the `init_chat_model()` API](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/). See full list of supported integrations [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html).

(2) ***The workflow, planner, refelection, outliner, and writer models need to support structured outputs***: Check whether structured outputs are supported by the model you are using [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).

(3) ***The agent models need to support tool calling:*** Ensure tool calling is well supoorted; tests have been done with Claude 3.7, o3, o3-mini, and gpt4.1. See [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/adc5d60c-97ee-4aa0-8b2c-c776fb0d7bd6/d).

(4) With Groq, there are token per minute (TPM) limits if you are on the `on_demand` service tier:
- The `on_demand` service tier has a limit of `6000 TPM`
- You will want a [paid plan](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/47#issuecomment-2640992272) for section writing with Groq models

(5) `deepseek-R1` [is not strong at function calling](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/reasoning_model), which the assistant uses to generate structured outputs for report sections and report section grading. See example traces [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/07d53997-4a6d-4ea8-9a1f-064a85cd6072/r).  
- Consider providers that are strong at function calling such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and certain OSS models like Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- If you see the following error, it is likely due to the model not being able to produce structured outputs (see [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/8a6da065-3b8b-4a92-8df7-5468da336cbe/r)):
```
groq.APIError: Failed to call a function. Please adjust your prompt. See 'failed_generation' for more details.
```

(6) Follow [here[(https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research/issues/75#issuecomment-2811472408) to use with OpenRouter.

(7) For working with local models via Ollama, see [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research/issues/65#issuecomment-2743586318).
